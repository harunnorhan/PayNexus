# PayNexus

PayNexus is a modular payment terminal simulation built as a
professional fintech engineering portfolio project.

The system consists of:

- Merchant Android Application
- Headless Android Payment Service
- Kotlin Payment Server

The required runtime communication path is:

`Merchant Application -> Payment Service -> Payment Server`

> Project status: foundational architecture, Gradle monorepo, agent governance, and code quality tooling are established. Feature implementation is in progress.

## Documentation

Project architecture and engineering decisions are documented under [`docs/`](docs/).

Key documents:

- [Project Charter](docs/project/project-charter.md)
- [System Context](docs/architecture/system-context.md)
- [Component Boundaries](docs/architecture/component-boundaries.md)
- [Engineering Principles](docs/engineering/engineering-principles.md)
- [Architecture Decision Records](docs/adr/)

## Project Structure

PayNexus is organized as a Gradle monorepo.

### Runtime Components

- `apps:merchant` — Merchant-facing Android application
- `apps:payment-service` — Headless Android payment service
- `server:*` — Kotlin/JVM payment server foundation

The mandatory runtime communication path is:

`Merchant Application -> Payment Service -> Payment Server`

The Merchant Application must never communicate with the Payment Server directly.

### Foundation Modules

- `core:model` — Framework-independent shared core models
- `core:domain` — Framework-independent core domain logic
- `payment:contract` — Payment boundary contracts
- `payment:domain` — Payment-specific domain logic
- `server:domain` — Server-side domain layer
- `server:application` — Server application/use-case layer
- `server:infrastructure` — Server infrastructure implementations

## Build Logic

Reusable Gradle configuration is centralized under `build-logic`.

Current convention plugins:

- `paynexus.android.application`
- `paynexus.android.library`
- `paynexus.kotlin.jvm.library`
- `paynexus.code.quality`

Dependency and plugin versions are centralized in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`.

## Code Quality

PayNexus uses the same repository-wide quality checks locally and in CI.

The current quality toolchain includes:

- Spotless
- ktlint
- Detekt
- Android Lint

Run all repository quality checks with:

```bash
./gradlew qualityCheck
```

Individual checks can also be executed with:

```bash
./gradlew spotlessCheck
./gradlew detekt
./gradlew lint
```

Run the full project build with:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

Quality rules must not be disabled, broadly suppressed, or hidden behind baselines only to make verification pass.

Version-availability lint checks are intentionally excluded from the strict quality gate because external dependency releases must not make an otherwise unchanged build nondeterministically fail.

## Continuous Integration

The [CI workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs on Pull Requests targeting `main`.
Its `Quality and Build` job runs on Ubuntu 24.04 with Eclipse Temurin JDK 17
and uses the committed Gradle Wrapper. The `gradle/actions/setup-gradle` action
validates Gradle Wrapper JARs before verification; snapshot wrappers are disallowed.
The Wrapper also verifies the downloaded Gradle distribution using its committed checksum.

CI runs these commands as separate, sequential steps. Use JDK 17 and the same
commands for local verification:

```bash
./gradlew qualityCheck
./gradlew build
```

Gradle setup uses basic, read-only caching for Pull Requests. This workflow does
not populate the shared cache, so cache misses are expected until suitable entries
exist. Cache availability is not required for verification.

The workflow uses SHA-pinned official GitHub and Gradle actions with read-only
repository permissions. It requires no configured secrets and does not publish
Build Scans or submit dependency graphs.

`Quality and Build` is the stable required-status-check candidate. Required status
checks for `main` will only be configured after the first successful remote run
has been verified as stable. Adding this workflow does not configure repository
protection settings or establish that remote CI has passed.

## Build

Use the Gradle Wrapper:

```bash
./gradlew projects
./gradlew tasks
./gradlew build
```

A globally installed Gradle distribution is not required.
